# conference-tracker

This is a simple project that I've built as a part of a job interview.

In this project, there are two actors namely Admin and Doctor.

Admins can;
- See, edit conferences and add new conference. Also invite doctors to a conference.
- See new topics added by Doctors.
 
Doctors can;
- See previous topics and add new topics.
- See and decline invitations from admins.

All these operations and data are stored on a local database on Android device for simplicity.
